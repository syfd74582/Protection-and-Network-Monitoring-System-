# ABSTRACT

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a software or device designed to monitor and detect suspicious activities within a network, as well as activities that violate network policies. IDS is a popular system used to protect networks from various types of attacks. Any intrusion activity or violation is reported to the administrator or can be centrally collected in a system known as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM). SIEM collects and combines information from different sources using alarm filtering techniques.

There are two common types of IDS: Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) and Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS). HIDS is used to monitor important operating system files, while NIDS analyzes incoming network traffic.

The working principle of an IDS involves placing it strategically within a network to monitor traffic to and from all devices. It performs an analysis of the passing traffic and compares it against a library of known attacks. When an attack is identified or abnormal behavior is detected, an alert is sent to the administrator.

In modern networked business environments, a high level of security is required to ensure safe and trusted communication of information between organizations. An IDS serves as an adaptable safeguard technology for system security when traditional technologies fail. As cyber-attacks continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, it is crucial for protection technologies to adapt and stay ahead of emerging threats.
